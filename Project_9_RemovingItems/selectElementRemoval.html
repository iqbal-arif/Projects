<!-- 
    Summary: in this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn how to use JavaScript to remove items from a select element based on a condition.

JavaScript uses the HTMLSelectElement class to represent the <select> element. To remove an option from a select element, you use the remove() method of the HTMLSelectElement object.

Suppose the <select> element has three <option> elements with the corresponding index 0, 1, and 2:

For example:
Value	Text	Index
A	Item A	0
B	Item B	1
C	Item C	2

When you call the remove() method to remove one element, the index will change immediately.

For example, if you remove the second element (B) with index 1, the index of the third element (C) will become 1:
Value	Text	Index
A	Item A	0
C	Item C	1

A common mistake is to iterate over the options of a <select> element and remove the element inside the loop without being aware that the indices have been adjusted.

For example, the following attempts to remove items with the values B and C. However, it only removes the item B but not C.
